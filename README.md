# REU AMI ASL Project

Classifying sign language using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

## Getting Started

If there are edits to the database file being made, add any number of arguments when running the program (python main.py makedb). 
Otherwise just run "python main.py" to run the program and instantiate the database. Running
this in Rodeo makes it easier to look into the database and mess with the data as needed.

### Prerequisites

This will be detailed in requirements.txt

```
pip install nltk
pip install matplotlib
```
